<b>Description:</b>
The Transportation Management System (TMS) is a personal project that challenges a team of developers (with a target of four team members) to apply the principles and knowledge learned in the Software Engineering Technology (SET) course. This project involves the development of a TMS prototype, a critical component of the shipping and logistics industry. The goal is to create a functional system that facilitates the purchasing, scheduling, monitoring, and billing processes for organizations involved in cargo transportation via trucks or trains.

The Transportation Management System (TMS) project features a set of capabilities that make it a robust and efficient solution for managing the order creation, management, and billing processes in the shipping and logistics industry. Here are the key features and capabilities of the TMS project:

<b>Order Management:</b>
1. Order Creation: Users can initiate orders from the Contract Marketplace, specifying cargo details.
2. Order Assignment: Orders are assigned to one or more available carriers, ensuring efficient cargo allocation.
3. Order Tracking: Real-time tracking of orders and their progress in the system.

<b>Carrier Management:<b>
1. Carrier Assignment: Carriers are selected based on available routes and capacity.
2. Trip Management: Trips are assigned to carriers to fulfill orders.
3. Capacity Limitations: System considers carrier transportation capacity when assigning trips.

<b>Time Simulation:<b>
1. Time Passage Simulation: Users can simulate the passage of time in 1-day increments, allowing for order and trip progression.

<b>Billing and Invoicing:<b>
1. Invoice Generation: Automated invoice generation for completed orders.
2. Billing Records: Storage of billing information and customer records.

<b>User Roles and Functionality:</b>
1. Admin: Configures and maintains the TMS application, manages data and initiates backups.
2. Buyer: Requests contracts, generates orders, and processes completed orders for invoice generation.
3. Planner: Assigns carriers, monitors order progress, and generates summary reports.

<b>User Interface:</b>
1. WPF GUI: Developed using Microsoft's Windows Presentation Foundation for an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
2. Intuitive Design: Minimizes data entry errors with intuitive UI elements, such as calendar widgets.
3. Efficient Workflow: Ensures that each user role's functions can be accomplished on one screen, minimizing navigation.

<b>Database Backend:</b>
1. MySQL Database: Utilizes a MySQL database for data storage and retrieval, ensuring data integrity.
2. Secure Access: Access to the database is through named accounts and passwords for security.

Project Management:
1. Agile with SCRUM: Follows an Agile project management methodology with SCRUM practices.
2. Milestone-Based: Progresses through milestones, including project preparation, design, testing, and demo readiness.

<b>Non-Functional Requirements:</b>
1. Speed: Ensures efficient system response within 2 seconds, minimizing wait times.
2. Error Handling: Implements robust error handling to prevent disruptions in system execution.
3. User Experience: Prioritizes a smooth user experience with minimal steps and data entry.
4. Documentation: Provides comprehensive documentation and code comments for future reference.


These features and capabilities collectively make the Transportation Management System (TMS) a powerful tool for organizations in the shipping and logistics industry. It streamlines order processing, ensures efficient allocation of resources, and provides real-time tracking and billing, all while maintaining data security and user-friendly interaction. The system's flexibility and adherence to best practices enable it to adapt to the evolving needs of the industry.
